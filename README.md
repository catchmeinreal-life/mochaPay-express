# MochaPay Web Client 💸☕

**MochaPay** is a demo digital payment platform, part of the broader **MochaEcosystem**, designed to power seamless and secure transactions within emerging communities—starting with MochaCafe, a conceptual coffee shop that accepts MochaCoin as payment.

This project serves as an entry point for users to **send**, **receive**, and **register** MochaCoin wallets using a clean web interface powered by the **MERN stack**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 User registration and login via email & password
- 💰 Load wallet by wallet ID & send MochaCoins to other wallets
- 🧾 View balances (upcoming)
- 📬 Receive payments via wallet ID or email
- 🔄 Simulated Lipa na MochaPay module
- 🌐 MongoDB Atlas backend for wallet, user, and transaction storage
- 🛠️ Built entirely with beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript (Node.js, React.js)

## 📈 Vision

In the next 10 years, MochaPay aims to evolve into a full-fledged **blockchain-powered fintech platform**, issuing **MochaCoin** (target value: 1 MochaCoin = KES 150), to power both in-store and ecosystem-wide payments.

## 🧪 Demo Mode

- 🌱 On registration, users receive **3 MochaCoins** (equivalent to KES 450).
- 🏪 Demo merchant (MochaCafe) and partner wallets are pre-seeded with 1,000,000 and 500,000 MochaCoins respectively.
- 💎 No smart contracts (yet); this is a conceptual fintech MVP.
